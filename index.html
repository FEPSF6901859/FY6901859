     Increasing efficiency in the chemical and pharmaceutical sectors is vital to reduce CO2 emissions, increase supply for consumers and to improve chemical processes. In the UK, offshore wind energy is the most efficient (and renewable) energy source due to the environmental conditions. By 2050, the UK aims to reduce 80% of total CO2 emissions so it is important to use renewable sources in these sectors. AI in management enhances operational efficiency and decision making in pharmaceuticals. An example is using GenAI in clinical decisions and drug discovery. The implication of AI can increase efficiency can be seen to reduce costs and increase supply by providing atomization. Implementing catalysts in chemical processes can reduce CO2 emissions by decreasing the amount of waste products from processes. These improvements in the two sectors would increase availability and reduce prices of important drugs, improve supply chain management and reduce CO2 emissions.

<h3 id="Introduction">Introduction</h3>
      <p class="ex1">  
Increasing efficiency in production of pharmaceutical and chemical products for these industrial companies would lead to three main improvements. Improving supply chain management in making these products would reduce manufacturing periods which would cause availability of drugs and chemicals for the population.  To reduce the amount of waste products made from chemical and pharmaceutical processes to create a more sustainable business. To keep costs down for manufacturers would in turn allow health organizations (such as the NHS) get necessary drugs for a lower price. In this study, industrial methods will be examined to increase efficiency in these two sectors to improve important issues phased in the UK.
