    <p class="ex1">  
    Increasing efficiency in the chemical and pharmaceutical sectors is vital to reduce CO2 emissions, increase supply for consumers and to improve chemical processes. In the UK, offshore wind energy is the most efficient (and renewable) energy source due to the environmental conditions. By 2050, the UK aims to reduce 80% of total CO2 emissions so it is important to use renewable sources in these sectors. AI in management enhances operational efficiency and decision making in pharmaceuticals. An example is using GenAI in clinical decisions and drug discovery. The implication of AI can increase efficiency can be seen to reduce costs and increase supply by providing atomization. Implementing catalysts in chemical processes can reduce CO2 emissions by decreasing the amount of waste products from processes. These improvements in the two sectors would increase availability and reduce prices of important drugs, improve supply chain management and reduce CO2 emissions.

<h3 id="Introduction">Introduction</h3>
    <p class="ex1">  
    Increasing efficiency in production of pharmaceutical and chemical products for these industrial companies would lead to three main improvements. Improving supply chain management in making these products would reduce manufacturing periods which would cause availability of drugs and chemicals for the population.  To reduce the amount of waste products made from chemical and pharmaceutical processes to create a more sustainable business. To keep costs down for manufacturers would in turn allow health organizations (such as the NHS) get necessary drugs for a lower price. In this study, industrial methods will be examined to increase efficiency in these two sectors to improve important issues phased in the UK.

The Uk industrial and manufacturing sectors are facing targets to reduce CO2 emissions by 80% by 2050 (compared to 1990 levels). Since energy consumption is the main source of CO2 emissions, improving energy efficiency in energy intensive sectors is key to achieving the target for 2050. However, energy consumption is unlikely to meet the targets unless new technologies and techniques are developed by businesses. (https://www-sciencedirect-com.surrey.idm.oclc.org/science/article/pii/S1364032118304775#s0005) 

The chemical industry is one of the largest industrial energy consumers in the UK, accumulating to around 12-15% of the total industrial energy consumption, this includes heating, cooling and running energy intensive reaction. The pharmaceutical industry (being a much smaller sector) accumulates 2-4% of total industrial energy consumption in the UK.  

Using renewable energy sources in these sectors would decrease running costs, create a more sustainable business and reduce energy demand. In the UK, the most viable renewable energy is offshore turbine farms due to higher average wind speeds compared to inland speeds

Solar energy output was calculated by the cost of one wind turbine and quantity of solar panels could be bought with equal budget. (Same strategy to calculate bioenergy).

The CF is the percentage of the wind turbine representative to one year where it is at maximum load. CF for wind turbines offshore is 40% percent whereas inland the CF value is 30%.

Interpretations can be made where wind offshore wind energy farms are the most efficient way to increase energy supply in the chemical and pharmaceutical sectors while reducing CO2 emissions.

AI has been seen to enhance operational efficiency and decision-making in pharmaceuticals in management (https://www-sciencedirectcom.surrey.idm.oclc.org/science/article/pii/S0360835224007770).  AI brings innovation and technological advancements in driving profound changes. This is done by providing new biomedical research. Generative AI has shown significant potential in several pharmaceutical and biotech applicants. 
This AI includes identifying specific needs for biological products based on public health goals, demographics and epidemiological studies. In addition, the application of Gen AI could facilitate the acceleration of drug discovery and reduce time and cost for new drug development.      </p>

However, challenges remain due to the complex nature of biomedical data and the need for accurate models. The genetic code (Adenine, Cytosine, Guanine and Thymine) joins together to form DNA. DNA is very complex and unique from person to person. Any mistakes in research caused by AI can raise ethical issues in allowing artificial intelligence to cause harm towards humans or animals. A solution would have specialists to operate and supervise AI technology but would lead to an increase in expenses.

The use of catalysts can be used in chemical processes to increase efficiency. Catalysts reduce activation energy (energy needed to make the reaction) by providing an alternative pathway by being used up in the reaction but when the total reaction is complete the catalyst is unchanged being able to be recycled for further reactions (https://r3.vlereader.com/Reader?ean=9780470011911).The choice of catalyst is crucially important due to catalysts being unique to certain reactions. This can cause catalysts that are rare to be costly for a chemical company such as Palladium, Rhodium and Platinum. A new innovative chemical called polyamide 6 (PA6) can recover expensive catalysts such as Platinum and Palladium. 

(https://www-sciencedirect-com.surrey.idm.oclc.org/science/article/pii/S0301479724030330#fig2) 

Providing an alternative pathway catalyst can cause otherwise harmful waste products to less harmful products (seen in a catalytic converter). Investments to higher quality catalysts in the chemical industry can reduce the yield of waste plastics, biomass and sludge.

<h3 id="Conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
    <p class="ex1">
The Uk has a challenging goal to reduce CO2 emissions, increase supply of medications on a national scale, reduce waste products and improve drug research. Methods discussed in this article demonstrate actions pharmaceutical and chemical sectors can implement to improve these issues. However, some techniques and methods face issues such as: 

-Offshore wind turbine farms are expensive source of energy (also requires maintenance on underwater cables 

-The use of AI in pharmaceutical research can cause ethical issues. 

-Catalysts (such as Platinum, Rhodium and palladium) are expensive precious materials so businesses may not have finance to buy these catalysts. 

However, these methods improve efficiency substantially in the pharmaceutical and chemical sector by innovative methods such as: 

-Offshore wind turbines are the most efficient renewable energy source and can increase energy supply and reduce CO2 emissions. 

-AI can improve supply chain automation causing quicker drug discovery processes, which reduces time and cost for new drugs in the pharmaceutical company. 

-Use of Catalysts increase yield of useful products (such as drugs and chemicals) and decreases waste products, such as Biomass 

Overall implementing strategies to improve efficiency will improve the total functions of pharmaceutical and chemical companies.
